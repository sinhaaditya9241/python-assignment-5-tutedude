# Python Basics: Student Marks & List Slicing
This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating:

1. **Dictionary Operations** – Creating and retrieving student marks.
2. **List Slicing** – Extracting and reversing elements of a list.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

###  Description:
This Python script:
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
- Asks the user to input a student's name.
- Displays the student's marks if found.
- Prints an appropriate message if the student's name is not in the dictionary.

## Task 2 : Demonstrate List Slicing 
This pyhton script:
-  Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements from the list
- Reverses these extracted elements
-  Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list
